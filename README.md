> A way to reduce the cognitive load of reading the news.

I made this app so that the experience of reading the news would be a little less distracting, ugly, and infuriating.  Tell it what news source you'd like to read and it will grab the stories from the front page and run them through a machine learning algorithm that makes a guess about the sentiment, or emotional content of a story.  It then renders that emotional content as a color, giving you the ability to decide whether or not you'd like to choose to read the story.

I made this because most websites,  especially news outlets, design their page layouts and content to maximize engagement.  This means they are trying to persuade, cajole, trick, and ensnare you into looking at what they want you to look at, for as long as possible.

Some even track your behavior and try to only show you content designed to delight or infuriate you, to maximize your interest.  I don't think this is a good way to absorb information.  Hopefully this tool will help!

Thanks for visiting!
